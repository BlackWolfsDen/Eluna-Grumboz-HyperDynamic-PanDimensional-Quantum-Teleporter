This teleporter requires a custom method for Eluna.
I sent a pull request to make it a perm method for future.
But until then it will need to be added manually to your core Eluna Module.

      int GetRealmID(lua_State* L)
      {
          Eluna::Push(L, eWorld->GetRealmID());
          return 1;
      }
  #endif
